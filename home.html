					The work very interestingly shows the life of a young man from another culture, with a difficult family life and an uncertain future. There are both positive and negative personalities in his life, each of which affects him in a special way. Thus, in the boy’s soul there is a struggle for his worldview, a struggle in which there can be no intermediate way out other than final victory - on the one hand, Nuur’s teacher, who sees in the boy a talented student and a worthy member of society in the future, and on the other, an imam , which inclines the boy to a radical interpretation of Islam and directs him to fight against the society in which he grew up.
